# DAV Community

The center of DAV's community sits at [my.dav.network](https://my.dav.network/).

It is the place for DAV enthusiasts to:

* Get updates about DAV network
* Discover opportunities to earn DAV using their own autonomous vehicle, or service
* Integrate directly with DAV through the blockchain
* View their DAV account

This project is the server that runs the community. You can also find the frontend part of our community in the [community-client](https://github.com/DAVFoundation/community-client) repository.

### community is currently under heavy construction!

Feel free to **Star** and **Watch** it, but watch out for falling debris.

Feedback and contributions are always welcome and appreciated.
